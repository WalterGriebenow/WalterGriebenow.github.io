1st round
Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of an autocratic and corrupt past president who is now in prison, has rebuilt Popular Force party and promised honesty. She is helped by the economic growth that allegedly come from her father's free market reforms. She faces Peru Wins a leftist party that is seen as a threat to the economic rebound, and a former prime minister leading a right coalition Alliance that promises to accelerate the free market reforms.
Political spectrum is equally divided between Left, Center and Right parties. Keiko's Popular Force and Humala's Peru Wins pass to the second round ballot.

2nd round

Humala's Peru Wins gets the upper hand by moderating their leftist discourse towards the center and promising social reforms without dismantling the free market policies that proved to be effective. Some good reforms are implemented but corruption scandals stain his mandate. Poverty in urban areas recedes but his voting base in poor provinces and rural areas sees little to no progress and are disappointed.
