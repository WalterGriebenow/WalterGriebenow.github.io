1st round
Humala's party Peru Wins introduced some social reforms but neglected his voting base in rural areas and poorest cities in the south. The right wing parties benefit from the delusion from a leftist government that promised too much. Keiko's Fuerza Popular leverages the memory of the economic progress during her father's rule. This time she wins the congress in a landslide but will face former prime minister Kuczynski's Alliance for the Great Change in the second round ballot. Votes move away from the center towards right and left parties.

2nd round

Runner up Alliance of Kuczynski capitalizes on the resentment towards the autocratic and corrupted government of Keiko's father and gets support even from leftist parties. They defeat Fuerza Popular by a tenth of a percentage point (0.1%) after a tough campaign. Kuczynski has little support in the congress and outside Lima the capital city. Fuerza Popular uses the congress to block all his initiatives. He is forced to resign after a video shows him trying to bribe some congressmen from some Fuerza Popular to support his initiatives. From political instability to Chaos.
