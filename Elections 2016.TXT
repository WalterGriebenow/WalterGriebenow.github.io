1st round
We are in 2016. Humala's party Peru Wins has made luke warm social reforms that reached urban areas only. It is involved in corruption scandal Lava Jato (Car wash) that unveiled huge briberies across several Latin American governments by brazilian construction giant Odebrecht. 

The right wing parties benefit from the delusion from a leftist government. Keiko's Fuerza Popular leverages the memory of the economic progress during her father's rule. She wins the congress in a landslide.

2nd round

Runner up Alliance for Great Change (AGC) capitalizes on the resentment towards the autocratic government of Keiko's father and gets support even from leftist parties to stop Fuerza Popular, which is seen as a threat to democracy. Kuczynski of AGC defeats Fuerza Popular by only 40 thousand votes. 

Kuczynski has little support in the congress. Fuerza Popular uses the congress and judges to block all his initiatives. He is filmed offering Fuerza Popular congressmen to join his party in exchange for money and releasing Keiko's father from prison. He is forced to resign.
