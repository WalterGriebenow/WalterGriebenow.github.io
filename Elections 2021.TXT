1st round: The country is in political disarray. Political parties get fragmented and new leaders emerge. All claim to know how to make the economic system work for all peruvians and stop the corruption in public spending. 18 parties compete this year including far right and far left extremist parties. Socialists and Communists of Free Peru, lead by a rural teacher from a poor province, win the first round with only 19% of votes, followed by Popular Force with 13%. 

Comment: Votes move farther to the extremes.

2nd round: A toxic campaign: Popular Force accuses the socialists of Free Peru to be terrorists, and to want to turn Peru into a dictatorship like Venezuela. They get support from the rich who own the newspapers and the media. Still, Free Peru manages to win by 0.1% difference. Fuerza Popular claims fraud without any proofs but with a lot of media support. Next five years will test the limits of Peru's weak democracy.
