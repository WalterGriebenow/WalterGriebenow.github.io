1st round
The country is in political disarray. Political parties get fragmented and new leaders emerge. All claim to know how to make the economic system work for all peruvians and stop the corruption in public spending. There are 18 parties competing for the presidency including far right and far left parties for the first time in many decades. Socialists of Free Peru, lead by a rural teacher from a poor province, win the first round with only 19% of votes, followed by Popular Force with 13%. Votes move farther to the extremes.

2nd round
The campaign is very toxic with Keiko's Popular Force accusing the socialists of Free Peru to be communists, terrorists, and to want to turn Peru into a dictatorship like Venezuela. They get support from the rich who own the newspapers and the media. Still, Free Peru manages to win by 0.1% difference. Fuerza Popular claims fraud without any proofs but with a lot of media support. Is this an announcement of another 5 years of political crisis? Will the democracy survive in Peru?
