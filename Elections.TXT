We are in 2011. Ten years have passed since the autocrat Alberto Fujimori left office after having almost destroyed democratic institutions, free press and credible elections.

He was ousted by popular uprising and marches after videos showed he was bribing congressmen from other parties. Still he is remembered as the president that defeated the communist guerrilla that threatened the country and introduced key economic reforms that resulted in increased growth. His daughter Keiko rebuilt the Popular Force party while he stays in prison. 

She faces Ollanta Humala from Peru Wins a leftist that is seen as a threat to the economic rebound and a former prime minister leading a right coalition that promises to accelerate the free market reforms initiated by Fujimori.
Political spectrum is equally divided between Center, Left and Right parties. Five parties account for 95% of votes, and Keiko's Popular Force and Humala's Peru Wins pass to the second round ballot.

Humala's Peru Wins gets the upper hand by moderating their discourse towards the center and promising social reforms without dismantling the free market policies that proved to be effective. 

Some good reforms are implemented but corruption scandals stain his mandate. Poverty in urban areas recedes but his voting base in poor provinces and rural areas sees little to no progress.
