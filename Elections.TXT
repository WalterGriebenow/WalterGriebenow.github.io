1st round
We are in 2011. Ten years have passed since the autocratic government of Alberto Fujimori was ousted by popular uprising, after videos proved that he was bribing congressmen and TV channel owners to stay in power. Still he is remembered as the president that defeated the communist guerrilla and introduced free market reforms that spurred growth. 

Keiko Fujimori his daughter rebuilt the party. She faces Ollanta Humala from Peru Wins a leftist that is seen as a threat to the economic rebound and a former prime minister leading a right coalition that promises to accelerate the free market reforms initiated by Fujimori.

Political spectrum is equally divided between Center, Left and Right parties. Five parties account for 95% of votes, and Keiko's Popular Force and Humala's Peru Wins pass to the second round ballot.

2nd round

Humala's Peru Wins gets the upper hand by moderating their discourse towards the center and promising social reforms without dismantling the free market policies that proved to be effective.

Some good reforms are implemented but corruption scandals stain his mandate. Poverty in urban areas recedes but his voting base in poor provinces and rural areas sees little to no progress and are disappointed.
